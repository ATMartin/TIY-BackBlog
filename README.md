# Backbone Blog

This is a tiny microblogging app written using the Backbone framework. 

It's pretty self-explanatory. Persistence is expected to come from a JSON-backed REST API, but feel free to fork and provide other dataset options. 

You can see this app running live at [http://development.atm-backblog.divshot.io/](http://development.atm-backblog.divshot.io/).
